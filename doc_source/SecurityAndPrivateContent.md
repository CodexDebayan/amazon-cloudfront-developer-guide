# Configuring Secure Access and Restricting Access to Content<a name="SecurityAndPrivateContent"></a>

For web distributions, CloudFront provides several options for securing content that it delivers, including configuring HTTPS connections, using AWS WAF to control access to your content, or setting up field\-level encryption for specific content fields\. In addition, you can prevent users in specific geographic locations from accessing content distributed through a web distribution\. You also have the option of restricting access to private content by requiring that users access that content by using CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies\.
